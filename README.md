## How to Play

Defend the ball from incoming enemies by destroying and dodging them using platforms. Platforms can be placed using the arrow keys. If the ball gets hit or goes offscreen (to the left) you lose! Note: Enemies can only be destroyed using the last placed platform

### Enemies

#### Red lasers

Red lasers move at a medium pace, come from multiple directions, and are able to be destroyed

#### Blue enemies

Blue enemies move slightly faster than red enemies, and are not destroyable

#### Pink enemies

Pink enemies can be destroyed, but move very fast so watch out!
