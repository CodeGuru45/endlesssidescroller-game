# 2D Java Game 

An original, simple side-scrolling game made using Java/JavaFX

## Motivation

I created this game apply many of the Java concepts I was learning as well as to challenge my creativity. I Inititally thought of recreating a game, but thought it better and more challenging to create my own. While there's a lot more feautures and depth that could be added (perhaps in the future), I reached a point where I fullfilled the original conception I had.

## How to Play

Defend the ball from incoming enemies by blocking and dodging them using platforms (Only the current platform can block enemies) Platforms are placed using the arrow keys. If the ball gets hit or goes offscreen (to the left) you lose!

### Enemies

#### Red lasers

Red lasers move at a medium pace, come from multiple directions, and are destroyable 

#### Blue enemies

Blue enemies move slightly faster than red enemies, and are not destroyable

#### Pink enemies

Pink enemies can be destroyed, but move very fast so watch out!
